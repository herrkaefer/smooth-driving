# What is a good driving from the passenger's point of view?

My defination of **smooth driving**

Let $a(t)$ represents the function (or time series) of acceleration. A good driving means $a$ is continuous and its derivative function $a'$ is also continuous, i.e., function $a$ is at least of class $C^1$. ([Wiki: Smooth function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function))

If a driving is smooth, there is no sudden braking, hard acceleration, and sharp bend, and more. In a word, smooth driving brings a perfect **passenger experience**.

# The goal of this repo

- Quantify the above defination, and evaluate the driving skill in real time.

- Design a social game based on the evaluation.
